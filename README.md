Please see the el-files within "configuration" for supported tools and languages, hopefully it's as clear and concise for you as it is for me.

## keymap system / rules
- there are global mappings for global commands to manage files, organize your work and better the user interface (ivy, winner, ace, whick-key ...)
- dont override global bindings, override its commands if there is a better one by the activated major mode
- bindings for navigating and handling code follow common rules tuned to respective language / major mode

## todo
- support language php
- support language typescript
